# 🍿 Let's Explore Movies! 🎥

In this project, I used Webpack and Babel to gain experience and practice. 
I utilized the [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to fetch movie data. There are different versions available that we can explore. 🌟🎬

Languages I used:

- **HTML 🌐**
- **CSS 🎨**
- **JavaScript 💻**
  
NOTE: I couldn't deploy this project on Vercel, as I encountered an unresolved error. Therefore, I will share a video demonstration here. If anyone has any insights or solutions, I would appreciate their input. 🙏

See you in the next project! 👋🚀
